## Hello and welcome! :wave:

* I built a [Sublime Text syntax definition file for Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-editors/elixir-sublime-syntax) with lots of care. I contribute to [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commits?author=azizk) and [Ecto](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto/commits?author=azizk).
* Created my first open-source project 14 years ago: [dil – a compiler in D for D](https://github.com/azizk/dil)
* Been using `Linux` for around 20 years (`Gentoo`/`Debian` -> `Kubuntu` -> `Xubuntu` -> `Manjaro`&`Xfce`).
